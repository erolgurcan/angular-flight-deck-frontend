      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        FlightViz works by connecting to your flight simulator software and
        collecting data in real-time. You can then view this data in
        customizable charts and graphs, allowing you to identify patterns and
        trends that may be affecting your performance. FlightViz also allows you
        to analyze historical data, which can be particularly useful for
        identifying areas where you may need to improve your skills or adjust
        your approach.
